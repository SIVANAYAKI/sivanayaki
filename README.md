## 💼 Projects

### [Project 1 AI BASED WOMEN SAFETY DEVICE WITH INTEGRATED VOICE MONITORING AND FEAR DETECTION MECHANISM]
- Description
This project is a smart safety device designed to protect women by continuously monitoring their voice and detecting signs of fear or distress using AI algorithms. It integrates voice analysis and fear detection to trigger real-time alerts to trusted contacts, ensuring timely assistance in emergencies.
- What it does:

Continuously listens for voice commands and emotional cues.

Uses AI-based fear detection to identify distress signals in the user’s voice.

Automatically sends alerts (SMS, calls, or notifications) with the user’s location to pre-set emergency contacts.

Provides an easy-to-use interface for quick activation of safety protocols.

### [Project 2 MUSIC GENERS USING MACHINe learing with python]
- Description
This project uses machine learning algorithms to automatically classify songs into different music genres based on their audio features. Implemented in Python, it analyzes sound patterns to accurately predict the genre of a given music track.
- What it does:

Extracts audio features like tempo, rhythm, pitch, and timbre from music files.

Trains machine learning models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, or Neural Networks) on labeled datasets of various music genres.

Classifies new songs into genres such as Rock, Jazz, Classical, Pop, Hip-Hop, etc.

Provides a simple interface to input a music file and get its predicted genre.
